Multer = Node.js middleware to handle multipart/form-data (which browsers use when uploading files)
Multer just receives and parses the file, we can then store it to desired location(either locally or on cloud)
Store it:
    üñ•Ô∏è Locally using diskStorage.
    ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud using platforms like Cloudinary, AWS S3, Firebase Storage, etc.


# Storing file in our local storage
    - when working on small scale projects
    -Multer receives the file via an HTML form.
    - DiskStorage tells multer where to save the file on our local machine, and what name to give it.    
    - File gets stored in the specified folder like "public/uploads"


# storing files on cloud platforms - Cloudinary is a popular choise
